Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. The main benefits of RAG are:

1. **Improved Factual Accuracy**: By retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base, RAG can generate answers that are grounded in real data, reducing hallucinations.
2. **Up-to-date Knowledge**: RAG can access the latest information stored in external sources, overcoming the limitations of static model training data.
3. **Explainability**: RAG can cite the sources used to generate an answer, making the process more transparent and trustworthy.
4. **Domain Adaptability**: RAG can be easily adapted to new domains by changing the underlying document store, without retraining the language model.

In summary, RAG enables more accurate, current, and explainable responses by combining retrieval and generation.
