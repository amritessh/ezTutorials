Sample Document for RAG Testing

This is a sample text document that will be used to test the document loading and processing functionality of our RAG system.

The document contains multiple paragraphs with various types of content including:
- Technical information
- General knowledge
- Sample text for processing

This document will be split into chunks by the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will create overlapping chunks to maintain context between different sections of the document.

The chunking process will help in creating a more effective retrieval system by breaking down large documents into manageable pieces that can be easily searched and retrieved based on user queries.

Each chunk will be assigned metadata including:
- chunk_id: A unique identifier for each chunk
- chunk_length: The length of the chunk content
- source_name: The name of the source file

This metadata will be useful for tracking and organizing the chunks in the vector database.
